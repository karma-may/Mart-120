GUI, or graphical user interface, is an interface that interacts with the computer using graphics. The point is for them to convey information using graphics, which can often be more user friendly than text. Clear examples of GUI's would be buttons or sliders in any given application. CLI, or cpmand-line interface, is a type of interface that interact with a computer program using text. This is interacted with only the keyboard. The first type of CLI I can think of is command-prompt in a computer. The benefits of CLI are that it has more efficiency and control over the aplication. GUI is good because it visually shows the function and is better for multi-tasking.
